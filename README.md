# ColorModifier
!ColorModifier Library!
This Library is to change output text color (Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, White) or change text style (Bold, Dimmed, Underlined, Hidden).

For instructions, please read the "sample.cpp" file!

And Finally, this library is developed for Consoles which support ASCII ESCAPES (unfortunately, Windows' one doesn't!)
